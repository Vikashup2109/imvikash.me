<Callout>
  Urban Culture uses a robust technology stack to enhance its service delivery.
  Next.js is used for frontend development for their website. Node.js and
  Express.js powers the backend along with Firebase and Firestore handle
  real-time data synchronization and storage needs, while GCP ensures high
  availability and performance for cloud services. <br /> Flutter is used to
  develop it's multiple mobile apps, providing a consistent experience to users

## Tasks I've been involved in.

### Backend

Responsible for the entire frontend development process, from initial design to final deployment.

- **Server-Side Logic**: Implemented server-side logic using Node.js and Express.js to handle administrative tasks such as user authentication, authorization, and data manipulation. This included setting up RESTful APIs for secure communication between the admin panel and the backend systems.

- **Database Management**: Integrated Firestore for database management, ensuring that the admin panel could efficiently manage and query data related to users, content, and application settings. This involved designing schemas, implementing CRUD operations, and ensuring data integrity and security.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Developed a robust authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and session management. Implemented role-based access control to restrict access to certain functionalities based on the user's role within the admin panel.

- **Data Validation and Security**: Applied validation rules to incoming data to prevent malicious input and ensure data consistency. Implemented encryption for sensitive data and regularly audited the system for vulnerabilities.

- **API Endpoints**: Created API endpoints specifically for the admin panel, catering to the unique needs of managing the application, such as updating user profiles, moderating content, and generating reports.

### Frontend

Responsible for the creation and maintenance of various backend systems, from ideation to final deployment.

- **UI/UX Design**: Designed and developed a user-friendly interface for the admin panel, focusing on simplicity, intuitiveness, and ease of use. The design incorporated feedback from potential users to ensure the panel met their needs.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the admin panel was fully responsive, allowing administrators to access and manage the application from various devices, including desktops, laptops, and tablets.

- **Interactive Components**: Developed interactive components such as dashboards, forms for data entry and modification, and tables for displaying lists of users, content, and analytics. These components were designed to facilitate efficient workflow and decision-making.

- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Implemented dynamic content loading to improve performance, reducing the load times for pages within the admin panel. This was achieved through techniques such as pagination, infinite scrolling, and lazy loading.

- **Access Control Interface**: Designed and implemented an access control interface within the admin panel, allowing administrators to manage user roles and permissions, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the application.
